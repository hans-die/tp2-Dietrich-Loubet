# Tp Edna - Image Editor

**Edna** is a simple image editor created for an academic project. It allows users to apply two quantization techniques—**Halftone** and **K-Means**—to modify and stylize images in creative ways. The program is fully interactive and provides the user with multiple options.

## 🎨 **Halftone Filter**

The **Halftone** filter simulates vintage print techniques by converting each RGB channel into a grid of circular dots. The dot size varies based on pixel intensity—darker areas produce larger dots. Each channel is rotated at a different angle to enhance separation and avoid pattern overlap, recreating a stylized, retro aesthetic.

## 🧠 **K-Means quantization**:


## ✨ Features
- 🧾 **Interactive prompts**: Allows users to customize point size, angles, and number of colors.
- 💾 Saves the processed images with custom names
