# 🎨 Edna - Image Editor

**Edna** is a simple image editor created for an academic project. It allows users to apply two quantization techniques—**Halftone** and **K-Means**—to modify and stylize images in creative ways. The program is fully interactive and offers users multiple customization options.

## 🧬 **Halftone Filter**

The **Halftone** filter creates a retro, print-style effect by turning each color chanel (RGB) into a grid of dots. The dot size varies based on pixel intensity—darker areas produce larger dots. Each channel is rotated slightly to create a layered, stylized look.

## 🧠 **K-Means quantization**

The K-Means filter reduces the number of colors in order to give the image a cartoon-like look. It applies the K-Means clustering algorithm in RGB space, replacing each pixel’s original color with the with the average color of its group.

This results in a simplified version of the image that maintains visual structure while reducing color complexity.


## ✨ Features
- 🧾 **Interactive prompts**: Allows users to customize point size, angles, and number of colors.
- 💾 Saves the processed images with custom names in specific folders.
