# Tp Edna - Image Editor

**Edna** is a simple image editor created for an academic project. It allows users to apply two quantization techniquesâ€”**Halftone** and **K-Means**â€”to modify and stylize images in creative ways. The program is fully interactive and provides the user with multiple options.
